CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

##Architecture

In this project, I worked on various methods of frontend development, approaches like Express HTML and JavaScript with a single-page application (SPA). The SPA might be considered a cornerstone of modern web development and provides for a seamless user experience, updating content without full page reloads, and making the application feel more responsive and interactive. This was in contrast to the more traditional, multi-page approach utilized in Express HTML, where each new page required a server request, leading to a less fluid user experience. JavaScript, as the programming language, was very code-friendly and played a pivotal role in orchestrating client-side scripting and enhancing user interactions.
The choice of a NoSQL MongoDB database for the backend was also important. MongoDB's flexibility and scalability made it an ideal fit for our application's evolving data needs. Its ability to handle large volumes of unstructured data provided the agility necessary to adapt to various data types and structures, a significant advantage over traditional relational databases.
##Functionality

Throughout the project, the relationship between JSON and JavaScript was crucial. While JavaScript is a programming language, JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format. The use of JSON appeared instrumental in tying together the frontend and backend. It allowed for a smooth data transmission between the server and client, allowing for efficient data serialization and deserialization.
Refactoring code was a constant part of the development process, enhancing functionality and efficiency. For instance, creating reusable UI components not only saved time but also brought uniformity and consistency to the user experience. These components, once tested and optimized, could be employed across different parts of the application, streamlining the development process and ensuring a cohesive user interface.
##Testing

Testing was multifaceted, involving API endpoint testing and ensuring security integrity. The application required testing various methods for request and retrieval, a task compounded by the complexity introduced by security layers. Understanding and implementing tests for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, each corresponding to different API endpoints was critical. Ensuring these endpoints functioned correctly, especially with the added security for admin login, was challenging but essential for the application's robustness and security.
##Reflection

This course has been very challenging for me. I initially had significant hardware problems and fell behind. I come from a mathematical background and my lack of understanding and experience building web applications made catching up very difficult. I found that I did not have the time and resources required for me to produce a working application each week. I found the interplay between numerous folders and files overwhelming at times. Nevertheless, this course has given me a basic understanding of full-stack development. Skills such as JavaScript programming, SPA development, API integration, database management with MongoDB, and security implementation are all invaluable assets for a career in computer science, no matter oneâ€™s concentration and so I am thankful for the work. 
Looking back, I see a path marked by challenges moving forward but should be better prepared for the next step.
